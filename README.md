Simple Calculator (Python)

This is a basic command-line calculator written in Python that allows users to perform four fundamental arithmetic operations:
	•	Addition
	•	Subtraction
	•	Multiplication
	•	Division

The user is prompted to choose an operation by entering a number (1–4) and then input two numerical values. The program performs the selected operation and displays the result. It also handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors gracefully.

	•	User-friendly console interface
	•	Supports both floating-point and integer arithmetic
	•	Error handling for:
	•	Invalid operation selection
	•	Non-numeric input
